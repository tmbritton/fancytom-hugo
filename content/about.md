Fancy Tom is an artist living in Austin Texas. As soon as he could hold a pencil he began drawing egg-shaped Batmen and Supermen. When Tom became old enough his older brother let him read the expansive collection of comic books he'd built through the 80's and early 90's. 

Tom was hooked. 

A few years later he discovered punk rock. A few years after that he discovered Photoshop. A few years later he discovered oil painting. After that he learned to code.
