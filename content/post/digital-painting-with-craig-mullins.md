I recently started the Schoolism class, <a href="https://www.schoolism.com/school.php?id=44" target="_blank">Digital Painting with Craig Mullins</a>. I realized I've not had much training in digital painting, and who best to learn from than the godfather himself? I signed up for the $30/month self-guided plan. I get access to the videos and assignments. I have to be honest with myself about if I'm doing the assignments correctly and be critical of my own work since I didn't pay for feedback from the main man.

### Assignment 1

The first set of videos talk about painting lights and darks in flat tones and the necessity of getting values correct. This isn't different that how I begin an oil painting. An interesting thing that painting digitally allows is the ability to paint in layers. And once you have shape you like in a layer it can be alpha-locked. This allows you to freely paint in the already-defined region of the layer and not disturb the rest of the painting. So if you want to paint just in the darks, you can paint just in the darks.

I've been using <a href="https://krita.org/" target="_blank">Krita</a> instead of Photoshop for this class. I'm using it because I like that it's an open-source digital painting program. Adobe now sells it's Creative Cloud products as a subscription only. While I could afford $20/month for a Photoshop subscription I really wouldn't own the software. Adobe could shut off my access to Photoshop if they wished, I'm sure it's in the terms of service somewhere. Krita is free, free as in speech and beer.

Krita also has a handy little alpha-lock button in the layers palette.

This is what I came up with in the first assignment. Focus was on painting in flat planes of color, and restrict detail and texture to the mid-tones.
