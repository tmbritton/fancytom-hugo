Zaftigg von BonBon asked me if there was anything in particular I wanted her to do for makeup when she came of for a portrait. Knowing that she has far more ability than I in devising makeup looks I just said "glam horror". If you've seen her acts you'd know that this is within her wheelhouse. I'd drawn her a few times when she modeled for the AVAA and knew that she was always wonderfully expressive when modeling. She always has that smile. So I knew this was going to be a great portrait.
